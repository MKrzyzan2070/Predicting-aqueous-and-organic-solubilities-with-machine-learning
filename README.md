# Predicting aqueous and organic solubilities with machine learning: a workflow for identifying organic co-solvents

This project introduces a machine learning workflow to identify organic co-solvents for a molecule of interest. The workflow combines two solubility modelsâ€”one being the aqueous solubility model and the other being the organic solvent solubility model. With the aqueous solubility model, the miscibility of potential co-solvents in water is predicted so that only water-miscible solvents are considered. With the organic solvent solubility model, the solvents are ranked based on the predicted solubility of the molecule of interest in them. 


## Project Structure

- **Code/**: All the Python code files can be found here. The scripts in the main repository, such as `AqSolDB_main.py`, call the functions contained in these files.
- **Datasets/**: Contains data files.  
- **Plots Images/**: Generated visualizations from the analysis.  
- **Pickled Models/**: For transparency, all the LGBM models were saved along with the data files on which the models were trained or their performance verified.  
- **Hyperparameters/**: Configuration files for the hyperparameters of the models.  
- **Jupyter Notebook/**: Contains code for determining the miscibility threshold.  
- **Pipeline Predictions/**: Results from the workflow.  
- **Experimental Comparison/**: Data files for the case study analysis that evaluates the organic solubility model's generalizability.


## Scripts to run (found in the main repository) 

- `AqSolDB_main.py`: Calls the functions that generate the dataset for training, testing, and validation, as well as the subsequent analysis of aqueous solubility (including generating the plots found in the manuscript). **Please see the comments at the beginning of the file for detailed instructions on how to configure the script for different usage scenarios.**

- `BigSolDB_main.py`: Same as above, but for organic solvent solubility.

- `Solvents_Pipeline.py`: This file mainly contains code for creating the images and plots used to visualize the identification of co-solvents. **As such, `BigSolDB_main.py` and `AqSolDB_main.py` must be run beforehand to generate the relevant datasets (see comments at the beginning of the file).** 

- `Case_study_analysis.py`: Script for the case study analysis, i.e., the assessment of the generalizability of the model.

### **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
The scripts can be run through the Python console or in an IDE such as PyCharm.
**All scripts must be run from the project root directory** Basically, when you clone the repo it can't be in a folder within a folder.
So, when cloning the repository, make sure that it is not placed inside an extra nested folder.

Some scripts access external websites. In certain cases, frequent or automated access may trigger a purge or rate-limit request from those sites.
In this case, run the code again some other time because the server might be overloaded.
